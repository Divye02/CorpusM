C hapter1 LIVING  VS. NONLIVING

Living things are both similar to and different from 

each other and from,nonliving things. The world 
around us is made up of both living and nonliving 

things.  Living things depend upon each other and the 
nonliving environment to survive.

Animals and plants are living things. They have basic 
needs  (necessities)  in order to survive. We often say that 
living things  (organisms)  are alive.

I.  CLASSIFICATION OF LIVING THINGS

Animals need air, water, and food to live and survive.

■  Animals take in air by breathing. They need oxygen, 

which is in the air.  Oxygen allows the animal to make 
and use energy, which it needs to survive.

■  Animals also need water to survive. Water is used to 
break down and move materials throughout the body.
■  Animals cannot make their own food so they must eat 
to get nutrients. Nutrients are necessary for growth and 
energy.

Plants need air, water, nutrients, and light to live and 

survive.

■  Plants take in air through their leaves. The type of air 
that plants take in and use is carbon dioxide. This is 
necessary for the plant to create food. Plants make their 
own food by a process called photosynthesis.

■  Water is used by the plant to move materials up from 

the roots to make food.

■  Nutrients from the soil enter the plant through its roots. 

Nutrients are necessary'for the plant to survive.

■  Light is one of the most important things for a plant. 

Light gives the plant the energy it needs to survive.

If the living organism does not get the air, water, food, 

nutrients, or light it needs to survive it will die.
