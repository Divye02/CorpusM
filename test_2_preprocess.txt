Plants take in air through their leaves. The type of air
that plants take in and use is carbon dioxide. This is
necessary for the plant to create food. Plants make their
own food by a process called photosynthesis.

Water is used by the plant to move materials up from
the roots to make food.

>

Nutrients from the soil enter the plant through its roots.

Nutrients are necessaryâ€˜for the plant to survive.
Light is one of the most important things for a plant.
Light gives the plant the energy it needs to survive.

If the living organism does not get the air, water, food,

nutrients, or light it needs to survive it will die.
